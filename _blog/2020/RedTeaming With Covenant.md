## Introduction to Covenant

Covenant is a powerful C2 framework designed to be flexible, modular, and extensible. It offers a range of features, including:

- Graphical web interface for managing operations
- Collaborative sessions with multiple operators
- Encrypted communication channels
- Dynamic compilation of tasks and payloads
- Extensive collection of built-in tasks
- Support for custom tasks and profiles
- Integration with third-party tools
- External C2 channel support

## Installation and Setup

To get started with Covenant, you'll need to clone the repository and follow the installation instructions provided in the README file. The setup process is straightforward, but you may need to modify the configuration settings to suit your environment and operational requirements.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cobbr/Covenant.git
cd Covenant/Covenant
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

Once Covenant is running, you can access the web interface by navigating to `https://localhost:7443` in your browser.

## Creating Custom Grunt Profiles

Grunt profiles allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of your Grunt implants. This can help bypass security controls and make your activities less detectable. To create a custom Grunt profile, navigate to the "Profiles" tab in the web interface and click the "New" button. From there, you can modify settings such as:

- Implant name and description
- Communication intervals
- User agent string
- Request headers
- Encryption settings

## Third-Party Integrations

Covenant can be extended through the use of third-party tools and libraries, allowing you to leverage additional capabilities during your operations. Examples of popular integrations include:

- SharpSploit: A .NET post-exploitation library with a range of utility and offensive capabilities
- Rubeus: A powerful tool for Kerberos manipulation and abuse
- GhostPack: A collection of security tools for Active Directory reconnaissance, credential theft, and more

To use these integrations, you can either import the required assemblies into Covenant or create custom tasks that leverage the functionality provided by these tools.

## Using External C2 Channels

Covenant supports the use of external C2 channels, allowing you to communicate with your Grunt implants through a variety of protocols and mediums. This can help evade network defenses and blend in with legitimate traffic. Some examples of external C2 channels include:

- DNS: Use DNS queries and responses to exchange data with Grunt implants
- Slack: Leverage the Slack API to send and receive messages with your implants
- ICMP: Utilize ICMP packets for covert communication

To use an external C2 channel, you'll need to create a custom listener and configure the appropriate settings for the selected channel.

## Advanced Task Execution

Covenant offers a range of built-in tasks for performing reconnaissance, lateral movement, and post-exploitation activities. However, you may encounter situations where you need to execute custom tasks or run complex sequences of actions.

To achieve this, you can use the "Task" tab in the web interface to create and manage custom tasks. You can also chain tasks together using the "Taskings" feature, which allows you to execute multiple tasks in a specific order, based on conditions or the output of previous tasks.

## Conclusion

Covenant is a powerful and versatile C2 framework that offers a wide array of advanced features for red teamers and penetration testers. By mastering these advanced features, you can improve your operational efficiency, increase your ability to evade detection, and ultimately achieve your objectives during offensive security engagements.
