# What is TempMail

Temporary mail services, also known as disposable email services are generally free email services that allow you to receive emails at a temporary address that self-destructs after a certain time elapses.

Users don't have to sign up or provide any personal information to use a temporary email address. 

**Anonymity:**
They allow users to receive emails without revealing their actual email addresses.

## Cons

So the mails you receive can be accessible from that service providers. And we donâ€™t know they are actually destroy the inboxes.

**Spam Avoidance:**
According to these services, incoming mails are said to be safe because they pass through a spam filter of their own. This protection can be ok for the newbies but for the experienced hackers its not working well.

Many temporary mail services reveal inboxes to the public. This means that anyone can access all the emails that have been received by that inbox. While this feature provides ease of access, it also poses significant privacy risks if sensitive information is sent to the address.
